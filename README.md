## Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors
- Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Creating 2 new attributes 'Age Group' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.
## Data Analysis
Seven pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as gender, orders in diff months, top states. Trends in order status, orders on diff channels orders and age comparison were also performed.
## Data Visualization
Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" were added.
Below the final dashboard in Excel.
